Terraform module to provision an IAM role with configurable permissions to access [SSM Parameter Store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-paramstore.html).

This project is part of our comprehensive ["SweetOps"](https://docs.cloudposse.com) approach towards DevOps.

## Introduction

For more information on how to control access to Systems Manager parameters by using AWS Identity and Access Management, see [Controlling Access to Systems Manager Parameters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-paramstore-access.html).

For more information on how to use parameter hierarchies to help organize and manage parameters, see [Organizing Parameters into Hierarchies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-paramstore-su-organize.html).

__NOTE:__ This module can be used to provision IAM roles with SSM permissions for [chamber](https://docs.cloudposse.com/tools/chamber/).  

## Usage

This example creates a role with the name `cp-prod-app-all` with permission to read all SSM parameters, 
and gives permission to the entities specified in `assume_role_arns` to assume the role.

```hcl
module "ssm_iam_role" {
  source           = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ssm-iam-role.git?ref=master"
  namespace        = "cp"
  stage            = "prod"
  name             = "app"
  attributes       = ["all"]
  region           = "us-west-2"
  account_id       = "XXXXXXXXXXX"
  assume_role_arns = ["arn:aws:xxxxxxxxxx", "arn:aws:yyyyyyyyyyyy"]
  kms_key_arn      = "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:123454095951:key/aced568e-3375-4ece-85e5-b35abc46c243"
  ssm_parameters   = ["*"]
  ssm_actions      = ["ssm:GetParametersByPath", "ssm:GetParameters"]
}
```




## Examples

### Example With Permission For Specific Resources

This example creates a role with the name `cp-prod-app-secrets` with permission to read the SSM parameters that begin with `secret-`, 
and gives permission to the entities specified in `assume_role_arns` to assume the role.

```hcl
module "ssm_iam_role" {
  source           = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ssm-iam-role.git?ref=master"
  namespace        = "cp"
  stage            = "prod"
  name             = "app"
  attributes       = ["secrets"]
  region           = "us-west-2"
  account_id       = "XXXXXXXXXXX"
  assume_role_arns = ["arn:aws:xxxxxxxxxx", "arn:aws:yyyyyyyyyyyy"]
  kms_key_arn      = "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:123454095951:key/aced568e-3375-4ece-85e5-b35abc46c243"
  ssm_parameters   = ["secret-*"]
  ssm_actions      = ["ssm:GetParameters"]
}
```

### Complete Example

This example:

* Provisions a KMS key to encrypt SSM Parameter Store secrets using [terraform-aws-kms-key](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-kms-key) module
* Performs `Kops` cluster lookup to find the ARNs of `masters` and `nodes` by using [terraform-aws-kops-metadata](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-kops-metadata) module
* Creates a role with the name `cp-prod-chamber-kops` with permission to read all SSM parameters from the path `kops`, 
and gives permission to the Kops `masters` and `nodes` to assume the role

```hcl
module "kms_key" {
  source      = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-kms-key.git?ref=master"
  namespace   = "cp"
  stage       = "prod"
  name        = "chamber"
  description = "KMS key for SSM"
}

module "kops_metadata" {
  source       = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-kops-metadata.git?ref=master"
  dns_zone     = "us-west-2.prod.cloudposse.co"
  masters_name = "masters"
  nodes_name   = "nodes"
}

module "ssm_iam_role" {
  source           = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ssm-iam-role.git?ref=master"
  namespace        = "cp"
  stage            = "prod"
  name             = "chamber"
  attributes       = ["kops"]
  region           = "us-west-2"
  account_id       = "XXXXXXXXXXX"
  assume_role_arns = ["${module.kops_metadata.masters_role_arn}", "${module.kops_metadata.nodes_role_arn}"]
  kms_key_arn      = "${module.kms_key.key_arn}"
  ssm_parameters   = ["kops/*"]
  ssm_actions      = ["ssm:GetParametersByPath", "ssm:GetParameters"]
}
```
